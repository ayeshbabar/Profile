              <p>
                I am a Muslim Pakistani girl, born in Pakistan. I moved to
                Australia when I was 6 years old, and lived there for about 8-9
                years before moving back to Pakistan to live with my
                grandparents as my father did not want to leave his parents
                alone. Of-course, I had acquired Australian Nationality before
                then. I now currently reside in Pakistan with my grandparents,
                parents, a younger brother and sister, Fatima, who is currently
                doing this subject as well. I can speak four languages, Urdu &
                English, which I am very fluent in, and Arabic & Korean, which I
                still need improvement in. I have completed my 'A' Levels in
                engineering from Beaconhouse School System and 2 subjects from
                Curtin University, Academic and Professional Communications &
                Culture to Cultures.
                <br />
                I enjoy reading books and watching my favourite shows on YouTube
                to pass my time when I’m free. I don’t have any pets at the
                moment, but I want to get a Persian kitten or a baby rabbit in
                the future. I love horses as well, but owning a horse will be a
                little tough so that’s out of the list!

              <h2>My Interest in IT</h2>
              <h3>
                What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start?
                Was there a particular event or person that sparked your
                interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).
              </h3>
              <br />My interest in IT started just last year, if I am to be
              completely honest. My dad is a software engineer and a web
              developer, so it is because of him that I’m doing this very
              subject right now. Last year, my dad really insisted that I
              complete a HTML/CSS course from LinkedIn Learning, and although I
              really didn’t want to, I managed to learn a little bit of both
              languages. It was when I sat down to write code when I realised
              that it’s not too bad, in fact, I began to find it a little fun.
              My actual goal is to become a UX/UI designer, but my dad once told
              me that designers should have a little background knowledge of IT
              as well. That will help them to create implementable designs and
              hence, fewer of their designs will be rejected by the developer,
              making the web development process easier and faster. This is what
              made me realise that this subject is important for me.
              <h3>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h3>
              <br />I chose RMIT for it’s amazing reputation in the field of IT
              and design. I’ve always wanted to join RMIT since I was a child. I
              passed by the university campus very often during my lifetime in
              Australia, and found the university appealing to the eye and
              something to look forward to. Since I moved to Pakistan, obviously
              I couldn’t experience the great campus life, so I decided to enrol
              online. Although I am not planning on completing a degree from
              RMIT, I think that the subjects they offer will be really helpful
              to my career.
              <h3>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h3>
              <br />From this subject, I want to learn the basics of IT and get
              a little background information about it. Since IT is a very vast
              field, I think this subject will really help me identify where my
              interests lie and whether or not I am suitable for this field. I
              expect that by the time I am done with this subject, I will have
              learned how to use GitHub without using git. I will be able to
              write simple code, and have a little know-how in the field of IT.
              I expect to gain a little more confidence in myself, and learn how
              to effectively work in groups.

                get there. I am planning to complete a bachelor’s degree in arts
                (digital experience and interaction design) in order to achieve
                my goal of becoming a UX/UI designer. Hopefully, nearing the end
                of the degree, I will have begun my internship. After completing
                my internship, I will hopefully get a good job in order to gain
                experience in the field, before I can land any leadership roles.
                I believe that following this path will get me all the skills I
                require. This plan will probably take me up to 10-12 years.

              <h3>
                Education Planner Organisation's learning style test report:
              </h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Auditory: 35%</li>
                <li>Visual: 20%</li>
                <li>Tactile: 45%</li>
              </ul>
              I am a Tactile learner!
              <br />I learn by touching and doing. I understand and remember
              things through physical movement. I are a "hands-on" learner who
              prefers to touch, move, build, or draw what I learn, and I tend to
              learn better when some type of physical activity is involved. I
              need to be active and take frequent breaks, I often speak with my
              hands and with gestures, and I may have difficulty sitting still.
              As a tactile learner, I like to take things apart and put things
              together, and I tend to find reasons to tinker or move around when
              I become bored. I may be very well coordinated and have good
              athletic ability. I can easily remember things that were done but
              may have difficulty remembering what I saw or heard in the
              process. I often communicate by touching, and I appreciate
              physically expressed forms of encouragement, such as a pat on the
              back. Here are some things that tactile learners like myself can
              do to learn better:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Participate in activities that involve touching, building,
                  moving, or drawing.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Do lots of hands-on activities like completing art projects,
                  taking walks, or acting out stories.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It's OK to chew gum, walk around, or rock in a chair while
                  reading or studying.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Use flashcards and arrange them in groups to show
                  relationships between ideas.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Trace words with your finger to learn spelling (finger
                  spelling).
                </li>
                <li>
                  Take frequent breaks during reading or studying periods
                  (frequent, but not long).
                </li>
                <li>
                  It's OK to tap a pencil, shake your foot, or hold on to
                  something while learning.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Use a computer to reinforce learning through the sense of
                  touch.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Learn best by doing, not just by reading, seeing, or hearing.

                overcome them. I was kind of surprised at the accuracy of some
                of the results and since all my weaknesses have been laid out in
                front if me, I have been able to reflect on myself, thinking
                about solutions that will work best for me and the people around
                me. As I’ve gotten to know exactly where my weak points are, I
                can work more efficiently to reduce them. I will try my best
                that I don’t become a hindrance or source of frustration for my
                team members. As I mentioned above, since I ‘ve realised where I
                can go wrong, I can work to avoid making mistakes. When forming
                a team, I need to make sure that some of my team members are
                extroverted, intuitive, assertive, and learn visually.
                Basically, they should have the traits that I am lacking in, so
                that the team can produce amazing outcome and results.

            <section class="project idea">
              <h2>My Project Idea</h2>
              <p><b class="bold">Name of application:</b> My Tutor</p>
              <p>
                <b class="bold">What it is:</b>
                <br />
                An application used by both students and teachers. Students will
                use it to find the tutor that best suits them for their
                appropriate needs, while teachers will use it to learn more
                about their students, their individual personalities and needs
                in order to provide the best for their students. Using 'My
                Tutor' can really save students the hassle of going through
                multiple processes to find the appropriate tutor. Rather than
                asking around, wandering from academy to academy, students can
                just use 'My Tutor' to check the teachers’ ratings/ profile and
                go straight to the teacher they require. <br />As for teachers,
                they will be able to read the students profiles, getting to know
                them better even before the students arrive to class, saving the
                energy and days taken to get to know their students. And the
                best part, all of this will be happening in one app!
              </p>
              <p>
                <b class="bold">What it does:</b> <br />
                ‘My Tutor is an application that will allow students to set up
                an entire academy routine. When making an account, students will
                be asked to provide information about themselves, their
                background and culture. Students will provide their contact
                information as well, along with their learning requirements.
                They will be answering some compulsory questions, and only
                teachers will have access to the students’ profiles. <br />After
                the ‘sign in’ process is complete, students will be asked to:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Select the subject that they wish to take tuitions for, for
                  example: <br />- Biology <br />- Physics <br />- Mathematics
                </li>
                <li>
                  Select the timings that they wish to study in, for example:
                  <br />-From: 4:00 pm <br />-Till: 7:00 pm
                </li>
                <li>
                  Select the preferred ratings that they would want their
                  teacher to have, for example: <br />Between: <br />- Five
                  stars to: <br />- Four stars
                </li>
                <li>
                  Select preferred academy or provide their location so the
                  application can suggest the closest academy to them. This will
                  be completely optional.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Select whether they want to find teachers that can come to
                  their houses to teach them or go to the teachers' house/
                  academy to study.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The app will then suggest teachers to the students, that match
                the rating, and timings for the subjects that the students have
                chosen. Students will then be able to view the teachers’
                profiles, select teachers to study with, and join their classes.
                The app will then create a study routine for them. They will get
                a notification from the app, reminding them that it's time for
                class, so they don't miss it accidentally.
              </p>
              <p>
                Students will also be able to rate their teachers and comment
                about them. They can give suggestions to the teachers as well,
                telling them what they think the teacher should have done to
                make the classes more beneficial. The comments and ratings will
                be anonymous, so the teachers, and other students will not know
                who gave which comment. This will make the students feel more
                comfortable and relaxed when giving the comments and teachers
                can read those and improve their teaching style.
              </p>
              <p>
                When teachers make an account on ‘My Tutor’ they too will be
                asked to provide their information and backgrounds, but in their
                case, their information will be public, so that students can
                view it. Hence, the teachers will be warned that they should be
                mindful of the information they provide. Also, the comments and
                ratings given by the students will be visible on their profile
                page for other students to view as well. After they have made an
                account, a class will be made for them automatically. The name
                of their class will be their "Name's Class", example: "Ayesha
                Babar's Class" so students can identify it easily. Teachers will
                then be able to view all the students in their class, along with
                their profiles and requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b class="bold">Why it is needed:</b> <br />Study competition in
                Pakistan is very tough. Parents always want their children to
                come first in their class, and score A+’s and straight A’s.
                Hence, nearly every second parent in Pakistan sends their
                children to academies and tuitions despite the fact that they go
                to school. Having been through this myself, I realised that
                finding good tutors, whose teaching style and class timings
                suited me was super difficult. Now my brother is facing similar
                issues. 'My Tutor' will make the process of finding tutors much
                easier and faster for students!<br />Looking at things from the
                teachers’ perspective, understanding students in order to
                deliver the best for them can be quite a tough and time taking
                task. Sometimes, even before the teacher has got a chance to do
                so, students will run away in search for other tutors, thinking
                that this particular tutor was not suitable for them, or could
                not fulfil their learning requirements. ‘My Tutor’ is a solution
                to this major problem, helping the teachers in getting to know
                their students faster. By reading the students profiles and
                background information, which the students will have written
                themselves, teachers will get to know their students even before
                they come to class. Hence, both students and teachers will have
                a happier and satisfying experience.

                project is successful, students will be able to find good tutors
                from the comfort of their homes and be able to go directly to
                the most suitable and best teacher for them. Looking for tutors
                will no longer take up their precious time, days and energy.
                <br />Teachers will be able to learn about their students’
                personalities by reading their profiles. This will help both the
                students and teachers be happy and satisfied from their learning
                and teaching experiences.
